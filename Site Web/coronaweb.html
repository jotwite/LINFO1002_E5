		<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Africa must "wake up" to the coronavirus threat and prepare for the worst, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			The continent should learn from how the spread of virus has sped up elsewhere, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
			He warned that while Africa's confirmed cases were currently low - around 640 - there was no reason for complacency.
			"Africa should wake up, my continent should wake up," said the Ethiopian, the WHO's first African head.
		</p>
		<p>
			Health experts warn that strained public health systems in Africa could become quickly overwhelmed if the virus takes hold, especially in overcrowded urban areas.
			<br>
			<br>

			In Africa, 16 people have died from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus: six in Egypt, six in Algeria, two in Morocco, one in Sudan and one in Burkina Faso.
		</p>
		<p>	
		Other African nations have been imposing similar restrictions:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Lagos state, the economic hub of <strong>Nigeria</strong>, has banned gatherings of more than 50 people and schools will close from next week</li>
			
			<li><strong>Algeria</strong>, one of the worst-affected countries in Africa, has closed its borders and stopped flights</li>
			
			<li><strong>Rwanda</strong>, which has 11 patients with Covid-19, is banning passenger flights after Friday for 30 days</li>
			
			<li><strong>Kenya</strong>, a deeply religious country like most on the continent, has suspended worship in some churches and mosques</li>
			
			<li><strong>Liberia</strong>, which dealt with a deadly Ebola outbreak several years ago and has two recorded cases of Covid-19, has stopped issuing passports to <br> stop people travelling and earlier this week banned entry to those from countries worst affected by the pandemic</li>
			<li>The Indian Ocean island of <strong>Mauritius</strong> has banned entry to tourists for two weeks - and confirmed its first three cases: two cruise ships workers and a British tourist</li>
			<li><strong>Zambia</strong>, with two Covid-19 cases, has suspended parliament and schools and university will close after Friday</li>
			<li><strong>Somalia</strong>, with one case, closed its air space overnight</li>
			<li><strong>Uganda</strong> and <strong>Botswana</strong>, which have no cases so far, will close schools from next week</li>
			<li><strong>Chad</strong>, with no cases, is suspending all passenger flights and closing some land borders from midnight on Thursday.</li>
		</ul>
